    " As a practical application, consider an advertiser who wishes to have advertisements on facebook or similar social media platform. They wish each person on the platform to see their ad but it is expensive to advertise to everyone. As it turns out, if they advertise to a person then all their friends on the platform get to see that ad as well in their timelines. Let's assume that everyone is friends with at least one other person. Thus, the company wishes to find the minimum set of people who are friends with everyone on the platform. One way to do it is to compute a vertex cover and advertise just to those people so that everyone is covered.\n",
