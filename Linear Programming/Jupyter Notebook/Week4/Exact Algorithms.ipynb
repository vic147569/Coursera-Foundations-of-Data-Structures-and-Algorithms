    "# Exact Approaches for Solving TSPs\n",
    "\n",
    "We will go over some exact approaches including the famous Held-Karp algorithm, followed by some approaches based on integer linear programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that a TSP instance consists of a complete weighted directed graph with $n$ nodes. Here a graph is complete if for all pairs of vertices $i, j$ with $i \\not= j$, the edges $(i,j)$ and $(j,i)$ exist. The edge $(i,j)$ is associated with a cost $c_{ij}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that an instance is symmetric if $c_{ij} = c_{ji}$ for all pairs $i,j$. The exact approaches below work on general, possibly asymmetric TSPs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple _brute force_ approach works as follows:\n",
    "  - Go through all possible permutations of the numbers $1, \\ldots, n$: there are $n!$ such permutations.\n",
    "  - Each permutation denotes a possible TSP tour. Compute its cost by summing up all the edge weights.\n",
    "  - Retain the permutation with the minimum cost.\n",
    "  \n",
    "The algorithm is simple, but its running time is $O(n \\times n!)$. This is because we go through $n!$ permutations in total with each permutation requiring $O(n)$ time to compute its cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "Can we do better than the brute force approach above? Indeed: we will now look at a dynamic programming algorithm by Held and Karp which solves the problem in time $O(n^2 2^n)$ for an instance with $n$ nodes."

    "The key idea is to think of constructing a TSP tour in terms of _combinations_ (where we try to delay specifying the precise order in which nodes are visited, as much as possible) rather than _permutations_. To do so, it is convenient to think about paths rather than cycles. \n",

    "\n",
    "### Basic Idea Behind Held-Karp Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to think about a TSP tour as follows: \n",
    "  - We arbitrarily designate vertex $1$ as the \"start\" and \"end\" points of the tour. A different node can be chosen instead of $1$ but it does not matter to the overall operation of the algorithm.\n",
    "  - Next, we think of the TSP tour as starting from vertex $1$, and a path that visits the vertices in the set $\\{2, \\ldots, n-1\\}$ precisely once and returning back to vertex $1$. \n",
    "  \n",
    "Let $S$ be a subset of vertices $\\{2, \\ldots, n\\}$ and $e \\not\\in S$ be a designated vertex (assume $e \\not= 1$):\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\renewcommand\\minCostPath{\\mathsf{minCostPath}}$\n",
    "Let us introduce  $\\minCostPath(S, e)$ as the cost of the shortest path in the graph that satisfies the following constraints:\n",
    "  - The path starts from vertex $1$, \n",
    "  - The path visits each of the vertices in $S$ _precisely_ once, \n",
    "  - The path visits vertex $e$ and stops.\n",
    "  \n",
    "If we can compute $\\minCostPath(S, e)$ for any subset $S \\subseteq \\{2, \\ldots, n-1\\}$ and vertex $e$ such that $e \\not= 1$ and $e \\not\\in S$ then we can solve the original minimum cost TSP tour using $\\minCostPath$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\renewcommand\\minTSP{\\mathsf{minTSP}}$\n",
    "Let $\\minTSP(n, C )$ be the minimum TSP tour on an instance given by a complete graph of size $n$ and costs given by a  matrix $C$, where $C_{ij}$ is the cost of going fron $i$ to $j$. We need not assume that the TSP is symmetric. I.e, $C_{i,j}$ need not be the same as $C_{j,i}$, in general.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following equation relates the cost of the optimal TSP tour against the minimum path cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\minTSP(n, C) = \\min_{e=2}^n \\left\\{  \\minCostPath\\left(\\{2, 3, \\ldots, n\\} \\setminus \\{e\\}, e\\right) + C_{e,1} \\right\\} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, to compute the minimum TSP tour, just run through end points $e = 2, \\ldots, n$ and \n",
    "  1. Find a minimum cost path that goes through all nodes $2, \\ldots, n$ other than $e$, and ends at $e$,\n",
    "  2. Add the value of $C_{e,1}$ to return back to node $1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The minimum value of $e$ among all these choices yields the cost of the minimum TSP. The image below illustrates this concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./held-karp-illustr.jpeg\" width=\"60%\"></img>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dynamic Programming for $\\minCostPath$\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now think about how to dynamic program for $\\minCostPath(S, e)$ for a given set of vertices $S$ and $e \\not\\in S$.  We approach it in four parts:\n",
    "  1. Stage the decisions we need to make and identify the optimal sub-structure.\n",
    "  2. Create a recurrence.\n",
    "  3. Memoize and compute value function.\n",
    "  4. Recover the solution.\n",
    " \n",
    "#### Staging Decisions + Optimal Substructure\n",
    "The key decision that we need to make for $\\minCostPath(S, e)$ is \"which order to visit the nodes in $S$\". We can stage this in multiple ways but the simplest one is to _decide the last but one vertex in the path_ (or the vertex that comes immediately before the end point $e$). This vertex has to be part of the set $S$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once we fix a vertex $s \\in S$ as the one that occurs immediately before $e$, we have to find the best path that goes through $S \\setminus \\{s\\}$ and ends up in the node $s$. We can then traverse the edge $(s, e)$ to complete the original task of ending up in $e$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Optimal substructure tells us that to find $\\minCostPath(S, e)$, we commit to a last-but-one node $s \\in S$. What is left over is in turn to find $\\minCostPath(S,s)$. I.e, the optimal solution to the former problem contains within it an optimal solution to the latter problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Recurrence \n",
    "Thus suggests the following recurrence if $S \\not = \\emptyset $.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\minCostPath(S, e) = \\min_{s \\in S}\\ \\left( \\minCostPath(S \\setminus \\{s\\}, s) + C_{se} \\right) \\,.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If $S = \\emptyset$ then note that $\\minCostPath(\\emptyset, e) = C_{1,e}$ the cost of going from vertex $1$ directly to end point.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Memoization\n",
    "\n",
    "The memoization here is different from what we are used to. Our memo table has cells which are labeled by two arguments $S \\subseteq \\{2, \\ldots, n\\}$ and $e \\not\\in S$ (also $e \\not= 1$). We have $O(2^{n-1} \\times (n-1))$ such cells in our table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the recurrence $$ \\minCostPath(S, e) = \\min_{s \\in S}\\ \\left( \\minCostPath(S \\setminus \\{s\\}, s) + C_{se} \\right) \\,.$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "tells us that we need to fill the table for sets $S$ of increasing sizes starting from sets of sizes $1$ and moving up to sets of sizes $n-1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Recovering the Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to recover the solution, we will label each cell corresponding to $\\minCostPath(S, e)$ with an element $s \\in S$ that produces the minimum value for our recurrence:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\minCostPath(S, e) = \\min_{s \\in S}\\ \\left( \\minCostPath(S \\setminus \\{s\\}, s) + C_{se} \\right) \\,.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have this, we can recover the path as follows: \n",
    "  - Let $s_1 \\in S $ be the minimizing solution $ \\minCostPath(S, e)$.\n",
    "  - Let $s_2 \\in S \\setminus \\{s_1\\}$ be the minimizing solution to $ \\minCostPath(S\\setminus \\{s_1\\}, s_1)$.\n",
    "  - Let $s_3 \\in S \\setminus \\{s_1, s_2\\}$ be the minimizing solution to $ \\minCostPath(S\\setminus \\{s_1, s_2\\}, s_2)$.\n",
    "  - ...\n",
    "  - Let $s_k \\in S \\setminus \\{s_1, \\ldots, s_{k-1}\\}$ be the minimizing solution to $\\minCostPath(S\\setminus \\{s_1, s_2, \\ldots, s_{k-1}\\}, s_{k-1})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming that $S = \\{ s_1, \\ldots, s_{k} \\}$ then we hit the base case at the last step. The path will then be\n",
    "$$1 \\rightarrow s_{k} \\rightarrow s_{k-1} \\cdots \\rightarrow s_{1} \\rightarrow e $$\n",
    "\n",
    "We are ready to code this up in Python. The difficulty lies in designing a data structure for the memo table each of whose entries are indexed by a set $S$ and a vertex $e$. We will use a list of python dictionaries to store our memo table in our implementation. The code is below and the comments serve to explain its workings."

    "## Degree-Based Encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "The simple idea is to constrain a tour as follows:\n",
    "  - For every vertex, we need to enter the vertex precisely once in our tour.\n",
    "  - For every vertex, we need to leave the vertex precisely once in our tour.\n",
    "  \n",

    "  1. First, the tour enters every vertex precisely once. For every $i = 1, \\ldots, n$, we have\n",
    "     $$ \\sum_{j=1, j \\not= i}^n x_{j, i} = 1, \\ i = 1, ..., n $$\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The main problem is that the two constraints above do not by themselves suffice to express the requirements of a TSP tour. I.e, all TSP tours must satisfy the constraints but there are invalid tours that satisfies the constraints, as well. The issue is that the constraints above permit \"subtours\".

    "  - There must be at least one edge leaving the subset $S$ i.e, an edge in the tour from a vertex in $S$ to a vertex outside $S$:\n",

    "<b> Theorem: </b> Any solution $x_{i,j}$ that satisfies all the constraints above must be a tour, and conversely, any tour satisfies the constraints above. \n",

    "<b> Proof: </b> The proof is to show that there cannot be any subtours. Suppose we had a subtour $S$ in our solution: $i_1 \\rightarrow i_2 \\rightarrow \\cdots \\rightarrow i_k \\rightarrow i_1$ if size $k$, then note that for the subset $S =\\{i_1, \\ldots, i_k\\}$, there can be no edge from a vertex outside $S$ to  a vertex in $S$. If such a vertex were to exist then some vertex in $S$ must have two incoming edges which violates the constraint of having exactly one incoming edge per vertex. Likewise, there cannot be an edge from a vertex inside $S$ to one outside $S$ since that would mean that some vertex in $S$ must have two outgoing edges which violates the degree constraint.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, the formulation above needs to encode constraints for $O(2^{n})$ subsets $S$. The precise number is actually $2^{n} -n -2 $, i.e, all subsets of vertices excluding the empty set, the entire set and sets of size 1. This is an astronomically large number of constraints to look at.  Can we do any better?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, one way is not to add the constraints but just start with the degree constraints to begin with. We iterate the following two steps:\n",
    "  1. Solve the ILP with the current set of constraints.\n",
    "  2. If the solution does not have a subtour:\n",
    "     - Return it as the optimal TSP.\n",
    "     - Else, if it has a subtour $S$, add the subtour elimination constraint for the set $S$ to the set of constraints, and go back to step 1.\n",
    "     \n",
    "In the worst case, the approach above is forced to add all the $O(2^n)$ constraints needed but in practice, we hope to get lucky and discover a TSP tour without needing to add all the subtour elimination constraints. "
