Thus for every edge we need to use to visit a vertex, we need an edge to leave. Therefore, all vertices other than the start/end point must have even degree. The starting point must also have even degree since whenever we leave the starting point, we need to enter through a different edge.

    "  - Construct the MST of the original graph $G$.\n",
    "  - Identify all the odd degree vertices of the MST. There will be an even number of them. \n",
    "    - Let $O$ be all the vertices of odd degree.\n",

    "    - Note that $M$ and $T$ can have edges in common. Therefore combining the edges results in a multi-graph where two nodes can have more than one edges between them.\n",
