    "We will begin our study of Shor's algorithm this week. It was first proposed by Peter Shor (a computer scientist/mathematician) at MIT in 1997 and represents a milestone in quantum computing. The algorithm can factor a semi-prime $n = p q$ (product of two prime numbers $p, q$) in time $O(\\log(n)^3)$ which is polynomial in the size of $n$ but on a quantum computer.\n",

    "We are given a number $n = p q$ and seek to find one of its prime factors $p$. Doing so, will help us break the RSA public key cryptosystem. During week \\# 1 we noted that it was a hard problem for classical computers. \n",
    "The best known classical algorithms have running time $O\\left(k^{\\mathsf{poly}(\\log(k))}\\right)$ for a $k$ bit number, wherein $\\mathsf{poly}(f(k))$ represents a polynomial of fixed degree involving $f(k)$. For instance, \n",
    "$O(f(k)^3)$ complexity would be an example of $\\mathsf{poly}(f(k))$. Overall, this represents a super polynomial running time in the size of the number. Currrently, factoring a 2048 bit semi prime is estimated to be impractical (too much time and memory) even using the best known classical computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the quantum algorithm we present now will solve the problem in time $\\mathsf{poly}(\\log(k))$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To factor a number $n$, we will proceed as follows:\n",
    "  - Choose a number $a  \\in [2, n-1]$ that is relatively prime with $n$: $GCD(a, n) = 1$. \n",
    "    - Finding such an $a$ is very easy since we can randomly choose a number $a$ in the range. \n",

Suppose $k$ is odd, then $r$ must be even since $p-1$ is even.

    "### Proof \n",
    "Let's get back to the proof of the theorem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the Chinese remainder theorem, we condlude that any $a$ that is relatively prime with $n$ can be represented uniquely by two numbers $a_1 = a \\bmod p$ and $a_2 = a \\bmod q$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let $r_1$ be the order of $a_1$ modulo $p$ and $r_2$ be the order of $a_2$ modulo $q$. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ a^{r_1} \\bmod p = a_1^{r_1} \\bmod p = 1,\\;\\;\\text{and}\\;\\;a^{r_2} \\bmod p = a_2^{r_2} \\bmod q = 1 \\,.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The order $r$ of $a$ modulo $n$ is in fact the least common multiple (LCM) of $r_1, r_2$. Why is that?\n",
    "This is because $a^r \\bmod n = 1$. Therefore, $a^r \\bmod p = 1$ and $a^r \\bmod q = 1$ (prove this as a simple exercise in modular arithmetic). Thus, by definition of order, $r_1$ divides $r$ and $r_2$ divides $r$. The smallest such number is the LCM of $r_1, r_2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $r_1 = 2^{d_1} t_1$ and $r_2 = 2^{d_2} t_2$ where $t_1, t_2$ are odd. We have $LCM(r_1, r_2) = 2^{\\max(d_1, d_2)} LCM(t_1, t_2)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, $r$ will be odd iff both $r_1, r_2$ are odd. In other words, $d_1 = d_2 = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose $r$ is even and suppose $a^{r/2}  + 1 \\bmod n = 0$? Note that this implies that $a_1^{r/2} = -1 \\bmod p$ and $a_2^{r/2} = -1 \\bmod q$.  This means that $r_1, r_2$ both divide $r$ (since it is $LCM(r_1, r_2)$) but neither divides $r/2$. This can only happen if $d_1 = d_2$. Let us suppose $d_1 > d_2$ (the argument for the  case when $d_2 > d_1$ is symmetric). We have $r = 2^{d_1} LCM(t_1, t_2)$. Therefore, $r/2 = 2^{d_1 - 1} LCM(t_1, t_2)$: But since $d_2 < d_1$, we have $r_2$ must divide $r/2$ which we assumed did not happen. \n",
    "Thus, we conclude that $d_1 = d_2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining, we note that the order $r$ is odd only if $d_1 = d_2 = 0$ and $a^{r/2} +1 \\bmod n = 0$ only if \n",
    "$d_1 = d_2 > 0$. However, for a fixed $d = d_1 = d_2$ the probability that the orders of $r_1 = 2^d t_1$ and \n",
    "$r_2 = 2^d t_2$  is at most $\\frac{1}{2}$.  Therefore, the overall probability that a random choice of $a$ fails is at most $\\frac{1}{2}$.  The probability of success is at least $1 - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}$. __QED__\n",

    "  - Once we find $r$, we note that with high probability $r$ is even and $a^{r/2} -1$ has a prime number common factor with $n$. Therefore, computing $GCD(a^{r/2} -1, n)$ reveals one of the factors of $n$. \n",
    "    - If we fail to get a factor, we simply repeat with a different random choice of $a$. We are guaranteed to succceed within a fixed number of trials with very high probability.\n",

    "The quantum part of Shor's algorithm attempts to find the order $r$ given $a,n$ very fast using a quantum circuit. Let function $f(x) = a^x \\bmod n$. \n",
    "  - Let $m$ be the number of bits to represent $n$: $2^m > n$.\n",
    "  - First we prepare a quantum circuit that calculates $f$ by translating its classical circuit using and/or and not gates into a quantum circuit represented by a unitary operator $U_f \\ket{j}\\ket{0} = \\ket{j} \\ket{f(j)}$.\n",
    "  - Measure the output register of $U_f$. It will yield some output measurement $k$ that we discard.\n",

    "  - Compute the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) of $\\ket{\\psi}$. Since the input super position is periodic with period $r$, the QFT will produce a result $\\ket{\\varphi}$ whose amplitudes peak at or near integer multiples of the frequency $\\frac{2^m}{r}$.\n",
