    "The possibility of entanglements in quantum mechanics was first proposed by Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen as a thought experiment in order to show that the postulates of quantum mechanics can yield physically counter-intuitive consequences.  They imagine two particles emitted simultaneously in opposite directions by a single atom that stays stationary after emitting them. If we measure the position of one of them precisely, then we know the position of the other. Likewise, if we measure the velocity (or momentum) of the other particle, we know the momentum of the first one. By measuring position of one of the particles and simultaneously the momentum of the other, we can seemingly \"cheat\" the uncertainty principle that says that position and momentum of a particle cannot be measured with accuracy at the same time (actually the uncertainty principle says something much more far reaching). To get around this contradiction, it was suggested that the two particles are _entangled_. Measurement of position on one, makes the momentum of the other photon completely uncertain.\n",

    "Entanglements are a fundamental feature of quantum computing. It is argued that without entanglement, the power of quantum computing is strictly decreased.\n",
